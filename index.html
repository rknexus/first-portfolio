        </h1>
        <p>
          I have over a decade of experience in the agency worldâ€”specifically in
          client management, client strategy, and long term strategic vision. I
          love to build relationships that result in trusting partnerships, and
          awesome work. I've been doing this a long time, I'm pretty good at it,
          and cherry on top I enjoy it.

        <p>
          I was the first Account Director at Fastspot. During my time in that
          role I cultivated meaningful relationships with all
          <a href="#">active clients</a> building trusting and long-lasting
          partnerships, all with a shared vision. I was dedicated to ensuring
          complete alignment with each client's unique needs, be it immediate
          needs or future needs.
